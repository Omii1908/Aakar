# Project-SADS

This project is a smartphone-based accident detection system designed to enhance road safety by detecting accidents in real-time. The system leverages React Native for cross-platform mobile application development and Python for backend data processing and machine learning.


## Technologies

**React Native:** Used for developing the mobile application frontend.

**Python:** Utilized for backend data analysis and machine learning algorithms.


## Features

- **Real-Time Accident Detection:** Uses sensors and machine learning to detect accidents as they happen.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Developed using React Native to ensure compatibility with both iOS and Android devices.
- **Data Analysis:** Python scripts analyze sensor data to accurately detect accidents.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and easy-to-use mobile application interface.



## Usage

1. **Launch the mobile application** on your smartphone.
2. **Allow necessary permissions** for accessing sensors and location.
3. **Start the accident detection service** from the appâ€™s main screen.
4. **Monitor real-time detection** and receive alerts in case of an accident.
