# Manthan - The Repository of Fundamental Knowledge

**Manthan** (मन्थन), derived from the Sanskrit word for "churning," is a repository that showcases my foundational knowledge and skills across various domains of computer science, including Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Computer Security (with a focus on encryption and decryption techniques), and programming in C and Java. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these topics through practical projects and code implementations.

## Introduction

The name *Manthan* refers to the ancient practice of churning, symbolizing the process of extracting knowledge by continuous effort and learning. This repository contains the core concepts that I have learned and applied in real-world projects, highlighting my progress in the fields of DSA, computer security, and full-stack Java development.

## Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This section contains my work on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, where I have implemented fundamental data structures and algorithms to enhance problem-solving skills.

### Key Concepts:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BST)
- Graphs
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming

The implementations are written in **C**, focusing on optimizing efficiency and understanding the underlying principles of each algorithm and data structure.

## Computer Security

In this section, I have demonstrated my knowledge in **Computer Security**, specifically focusing on the implementation of **encryption** and **decryption techniques** using **C**.

### Encryption & Decryption Techniques:
- **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher that shifts characters in the alphabet.
- **RSA Algorithm**: A public-key encryption technique for secure data transmission.
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A symmetric key encryption standard used globally.

The security implementations aim to provide a foundational understanding of cryptographic algorithms and their practical usage in securing data.

## Java Programs & Projects 

### Library Management System

This project is an **object-oriented library management system** designed using **Java**. It serves as a real-world application to manage the inventory and operations of a library, including book checkouts, user registration, and fine management.

#### Features:
- User authentication (Admin and Member roles)
- Book search and catalog management
- Borrowing and returning books
- Fine calculation for overdue books
- Database management using file handling

This project demonstrates the practical use of **Java** in building functional and scalable applications.

## Technologies Used

- **C** for DSA and Computer Security implementations
- **Java** for the Library Management System project
- **Algorithms and Data Structures** for problem-solving
- **Git** for version control
