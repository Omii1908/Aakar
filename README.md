## 📖 Introduction

In the spirit of *Manthan*, this repository is my personal effort to **extract clarity from complexity** by mastering core CS subjects like:

- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**
- **Computer Security & Cryptography**
- **Java-based Software Development**

Each section is rooted in practice — not just theory — and reflects my journey as a learner aiming to solve real-world problems with clean and effective code.

## 📐 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

> ✍️ Implemented using **C** for performance and concept clarity.

A solid foundation in DSA empowers problem-solving in any tech stack. This section contains well-organized code categorized by algorithmic strategies and data structure types.

### 📂 Categories:
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Trees (Binary Trees, BST, Traversals)
- Graphs (DFS, BFS, Topological Sort)
- Sorting (Merge, Quick, Heap, Insertion, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear)
- Mathematical Algorithms (GCD, Prime Sieve, Modulo Tricks)
- Bit Manipulation
- Sliding Window & Two Pointers
- Divide & Conquer
- Backtracking & Recursion
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Union-Find / Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

## 🔐 Computer Security

> 👨‍💻 Hands-on cryptography with **C** – understanding how data is protected.

This section explores practical cryptographic algorithms and how they secure digital communication. Algorithms are built from scratch for conceptual depth.

### 🔑 Techniques Covered:
- 🔏 **Caesar Cipher** – Simple letter shifting
- 🔐 **RSA Algorithm** – Public key cryptography
- 🔒 **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** – Block cipher using symmetric keys

The goal here is to grasp **how security works under the hood**.

## 🧰 Java Programs & Projects

### 📘 Library Management System (Java)

A console-based, object-oriented Java project to manage a digital library. Built with file handling instead of a database to understand core Java features.

#### 🔍 Features:
- Role-based authentication (Admin/Member)
- Add/search/borrow/return books
- Late return fine calculation
- File-based record storage

> 📌 Demonstrates real-world application design with **OOP**, file handling, and modular code.
