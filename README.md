## 🔐 Computer Security

> 👨‍💻 Core cryptographic techniques implemented in **C**, built from scratch to understand how encryption really works under the hood.

### 🔑 Techniques Covered:

- **Caesar Cipher** – Basic substitution technique
- **RSA Algorithm** – Asymmetric encryption using public/private keys
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** – Introduction to symmetric key encryption using block ciphers

> 🔐 Each implementation highlights key operations like key generation, modular arithmetic, and message encoding/decoding.

## 🧰 Java Programs & Projects

### 📘 Library Management System – Java Console Application

A command-line based library system that demonstrates Java programming using OOP and file handling (no database used).

#### 🔍 Features:

- 📛 Role-based access: Admin & Member
- 📚 Book management: Add, view, search, borrow, return
- 📅 Fine calculation for late returns
- 🗂️ Persistent file-based data storage
- 🧱 Modular & maintainable code

> 📌 A practical way to learn OOP principles, control structures, and working with file systems.
